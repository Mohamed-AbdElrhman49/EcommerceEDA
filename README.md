## ✅ Conclusion

Our sales do not exhibit recurring, constantly changing patterns. Our highest sales were in May 2023, with over 970 items sold.

Our product prices are similar; no category is noticeably more expensive than another.

Sports products are our best-selling and most profitable.

Discounts and promotions do not significantly impact sales.

Customer categories are similar in number, yet the regular category has the highest consumption rate.
